# Instructions

Here are some guidelines for contributing to the Formal abstracts project.

## Prerequisites

* basic knowledge of and an installation of the [Lean prover](http://leanprover.github.io)
* basic knowledge of and an installation of [git](https://git-scm.com)
* a [GitHub](https://github.com) account

## Getting started

We recommend that you browse through the [`fabstracts`](./fabstracts) folder and get a
feel for what a typical fabstract looks like. The [`folklore`](./folklore) folder contains
common definitions, have a look at it as well.

Once you are ready to contribute, you should fork
the [`formalabstracts` repository](https://github.com/formalabstracts/formalabstracts),
and clone it to your local computer. This way you will be able to make a pull request
later.

## What to contribute

The project has only just gotten off the ground, so there is plenty to do. We are still in
a highly experimental phase and we welcome ideas on how to get organized. Above all, we
need examples of fabstracts.

## How to contribute

Make additions and changes in your fork of the repository, and make a [pull request](https://github.com/formalabstracts/formalabstracts/pulls) once you are done.
