The `folklore` folder contains common definitions. Fabstracts refere to these so that they
need not implement everything from teh bottom up all the time.

The folklore is *not* finished, and it very likely never will be. It is quite permissible
to postulate objects or facts with `constant` and `axiom`, but please do make sure to
write comments about what they are supposed to be.
